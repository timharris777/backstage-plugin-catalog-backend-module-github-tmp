# Catalog Backend Module for GitHub

Temporary repo until my PR gets merged in and a new release is made with changes

This is an extension module to the plugin-catalog-backend plugin, providing extensions targeted at GitHub offerings.

## Getting started

See [Backstage documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/discovery) for details on how to install
and configure the plugin.
